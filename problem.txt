ticket_date
user_email
user_full_name
user_phone
ticket_title
ticket_description
ticket_status_id
"ticket_status" with the following fields:
status_id

create a view in the database that joins the two tables in a single view
create two JSON API Endpoints:
"insert_ticket" that will insert the ticket into the DB

ticket_date
user_email
user_full_name

message
"update_ticket_status" that will update the ticket in the db

create a simple HTML page for each endpoint with the form to insert the data and send that form data via AJAX to the API and display the response
